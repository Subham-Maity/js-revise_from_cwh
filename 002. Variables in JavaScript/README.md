### Simple talk about variables

#### 1. js variables is a container for a value of any type of data (string, number, boolean, object, etc.)

#### 2. js variables are named by using the `var` keyword and then the name of the variable. 

#### 3. The value of a variable can be changed after it has been declared. 

```js
    var name = "John";
    name = "Jane";
    console.log(name);
    // "Jane"
```
#### 4. Rules for naming variables in JavaScript
* A variable name must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
* js reserved words cannot be used as variable names. 
* case sensitive. 

#### var vs let
  * var is function scoped.
  * let is block scoped. 
  * var is faster than let.
